# SolidFS

SolidFS is a [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) driver for [Solid](https://solidproject.org/).

It is very limited in what it can support but is able to interact with Solid Pods.

Some of the limitations are:
1. shortcomings in this code
2. related to server implementations
3. related to the current Solid specification

There is no plan to resolve any one of the specific shortcomings as at 2024-04-11.

## Warning

There is no warranty with this tool and it may break your content on your machine, in your Pod or both. At this time you should only use this tool if you can cope with the consequences of that.

## Running

It's currently very hard to run this from source. You may find the Docker approach the easiest if you're unsure of what to do.

### Configuration

In the `.env` file there are a number of settings.

#### SOLIDFS_BASE_URL

This is the most important setting.

You can [get a Pod](https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod) from many places, but this tool is only tested with [PodSpaces](https://start.inrupt.com/) so far.

The value should be something like this:

```
https://storage.inrupt.com/ecce92aa-5fa3-4333-8883-4917c405d4d5
```

Note there is no trailing slash.

Interestingly you can also mount a Container deeper within a Pod. This is useful if you only have access to a small part of a Pod. In that case you'd have a value such as this:

```
https://storage.inrupt.com/ecce92aa-5fa3-4333-8883-4917c405d4d5/some/part/for/me
```

#### SOLIDFS_CLIENT_ID and SOLIDFS_CLIENT_SECRET

At the moment this tool uses client credentials.

If you are using PodSpaces you can generate them in the [OpenID Broker Registration page](https://login.inrupt.com/registration.html). Of course you should keep them secret because they allow something with those credentials to do anything you can do.

#### SOLIDFS_TOKEN_URL

This is the endpoint where the credentials are exchanged for an access token. If you're using PodSpaces then just use `https://login.inrupt.com/token`

#### SOLIDFS_CONTENT_CACHING

There is a very rudimentary caching mechanism in the tool. This turns it on with a `1` or off with anything else, for example `0` or if you don't set it.

A very conspicuous side-effect of the caching is that you won't see changes made by other things to the Pod unless you restart SolidFS.

### Python

We're assuming you are mounting your Solid Pod at `/data/`.

You may be successful with:
1. a suitable Python environment with the [requirements](requirements.txt)
2. set the environment variables mentioned in [.env.sample](.env.sample)
3. python3 src/solidfs.py -fd /data/

### Docker

You can mount the FUSE device inside the container and therefore use Docker to mount your Pod. Although the code works in a [rootless podman container](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md), it doesn't appear in the host OS which is a problem in most use-cases but may be OK for your use-case.

#### Provide Access to root

`cd` to the place you want to mount your Pod, or alter the `$(pwd)` part of the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  --rm \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --device=/dev/fuse \
  --name solidfs \
  -v $(pwd)/:/data/:rshared \
  --env-file ${HOME}/.env \
  myforest/solidfs \
 -fd /data/
```
#### Provide Access to All Users
In the very likely case that you want to access the Pod mount as a normal user you will want to add the `-o allow_other` option. Of course this means other people on your machine can see your Pod so be thoughtful about that.

`cd` to the place you want to mount your Pod, or alter the `$(pwd)` part of the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  --rm \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --device=/dev/fuse \
  --name solidfs \
  -v $(pwd)/:/data/:rshared \
  --env-file ${HOME}/.env \
  myforest/solidfs \
 -fd -o allow_other /data/
```

### Building

If you'd like to build the container locally use a command such as this:

```bash
docker build -t myforest/solidfs  .
```


## Using

In these examples we assume your working directory is the place you mounted your Pod.

### Simple Listing

Start off gently:

```bash
ls -lh
```
You may see some output like this:
```
total 0
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Jul 20  2022 bookmarks
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Jul 23  2022 contacts
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Jul 20  2022 inbox
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Jul 20  2022 policies
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Jul 20  2022 private
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Apr  9 18:40 profile
drwx------. 2 root root 0 Jul 20  2022 settings
```

### Delving into the Filesystem

Being more adventerous:

```bash
find test/bob/
```
In my Pod this returns:
```
/data/test/bob/
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢/test.html
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢/date2.txt
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢/date3.txt
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢/date4.txt
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢/card.ttl
/data/test/bob/b2oüêù/ü¶ñ/ü¶¢/üå≥
```

### rsync to Replicate Lots of Resources

Here I'm using an existing tool to push some content up to my Pod without writing any new code:

```bash
rsync -av weather/2023/2023-04 solid/weather/
```

```
sending incremental file list
2023-04/
2023-04/2023-04-01.txt
2023-04/2023-04-02.txt
2023-04/2023-04-03.txt
...
2023-04/2023-04-29.txt
2023-04/2023-04-30.txt

sent 606,817 bytes  received 590 bytes  3,480.84 bytes/sec
total size is 604,760  speedup is 1.00
```

### Clean up a Folder Recursively

Cleaning up:

```bash
rm -rf solid/weather/
```

### Search Resource Content

Here I'm looking for something in a file:

```bash
$ grep name solid/profile/card
vcard:organization-name  "MyForest" ;
foaf:name                "MyForest ü¶Ü" .
```

### Visual Studio Code

Here is a graphical tool using the file system mount:

### Show Extended Attributes

Using the [extended file attribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes) support of the file system allows us to report additional properties for Resources. Here we are including the content type which can be seen using the extended attribute tool `exa` which shows the extended attributes as a list under each file:

```
$ exa -@l

                                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user.mime_type: "image/png"
```

## Developing

There is no guidance on this yet.

### Using Values in structlog Context

1. Only bind to values that are safe.
2. Don't include security-sensitive information in logs, such as access tokens or headers that contain them.
3. 

## Testing

With a Pod mounted at `/data/` run:

```bash
pytest -n auto test/*.py
```
```

## Similar Projects

### Visual Studio Code Extension solidFS

[Jesse Wright](https://github.com/jeswr) has had a [solidFS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeswr.solidfs) extension for VSCode for a while. We agreed there won't be confusion because SolidFS will never be a VSCode extension. Despite the similar names David Bowen opted for "SolidFS" to align with [other FUSE driver naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace#Remote/distributed_file_system_clients).

### Solid File Client

There are a number of [Solid apps](https://solidproject.org/apps), for example Jeff Zucker's [solid-file-client](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client) can be used to do many of the things SolidFS would do, but solid-file-client has Solid-focused parts such as specifying the content type for files which can't be done using normal file interactions via FUSE.

### bash-like Functions for Solid

SolidLab have a [bashlib](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/Bashlib/) tool which uses TypeScript to implement the file management functions. By using custom commands it provides more options on each command than you get with SolidFS.
